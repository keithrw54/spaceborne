# Spaceborne

Welcome to spaceborne. Your new tool for testing of RESTful APIs. This builds on the great work of brooklyn/airborne, which I think is very useful, but has some major shortcomings. It also leverages curlyrest which allows easily adding a header parameter to an API request, and causes the request to be processed/exposed as a curl command.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'spaceborne'
```

And then execute:

```ruby
$ bundle
```

Or install it yourself as:

```ruby
$ gem install spaceborne
```

## Creating API tests

### Making a request

Spaceborne/airborne use curlyrest/rest-client to make the API requests. These are done in the manner that you actually think about the request, the http action verb, the url, body(optional depending on the verb) and headers. When creating a test, you can call any of the following methods: get, post, put, patch, delete, head, options.

#### Parts of a request

| part | description | restrictions |
|:--- |:----|:----|
|url|uri describing destination of the request|not including query/fragment|
|body|data being passed in the request|not on head/get requests|
|headers|hash of request headers|*optional request modifiers*|
|query|data passed on url after '?'|added as a 'params' hash in headers|

#### Optional request modifiers
These are passed as headers, but will be removed from the actual request, having the desired effect.

| modifier | values | effect|
|:---|:---|:---|
|:use_curl| true, 'debug'|executes the command via curl, and if 'debug', output the command and response|
|:use_proxy| url of the proxy | sends the request to the proxy |
|:nonjson_data|true|forces content-type to application/x-www-form-urlencoded|

#### Request examples
passing request headers

```ruby
get 'http://example.com/api/v1/my_api', { 'x-auth-token' => 'my_token' }
```

passing a body (`post`, `put`, `patch`, `delete`) as a hash

```ruby
post 'http://example.com/api/v1/my_api', { :name => 'John Doe' }, { 'x-auth-token' => 'my_token' }
```

passing Query params via headers

```ruby
post 'http://example.com/api/v1/my_api', { }, { 'params' => {'param_key' => 'param_value' } }
```

make the request using curl and show me the entire request/response

```ruby
get 'http://example.com/api/v1/my_api', { 'x-auth-token' => 'my_token', use_curl: 'debug' }
```


### Validating a response

Most of the power of spaceborne comes from being able to write expectations in a compact form that has great power at being able to perform the actual validation you have in mind. This allows you to build up positive and negative test cases and choose what parts of the response are important, or ignored. Here's an example that we'll look at.

```ruby
require 'spaceborne'

describe 'simple get sample' do
  it 'should pass validation' do
    wrap_request do
      get 'http://example.com/api/v1/simple_get' #json api that returns { "name" : "John Doe" }
      expect_json_types(name: :string)
      expect_json(name: 'John Doe')
    end
  end
end
```
The parts of the example outside of the `wrap_request` block are typical rspec. The `wrap_request` is a spaceborne concept, saying that if anything fails inside of that block, then the failure contains the last request, response, as well as why it failed. This is to work around the issue of an expectation failing, and having good info about why, but having no idea what the request or response were that caused the failure. The actual request is done on the `get` line. Validation of the response is the following `expect_*` lines.

#### Parts of response to validate

* HTTP Status
	* `expect_status`(200) - expect to get a status of 200
* Headers
	* `expect_header`(validators)
	* `expect_header_types`(validators)
* JSON
	* `expect_json`(validators)
	* `expect_json`(path, validators)
	* `expect_json_types`(validators)
	* `expect_json_types`(path, validators)
	* `expect_json_keys`(validators)
	* `expect_json_keys`(path, validators)
	* `expect_json_sizes`(validators)
	* `expect_json_sizes`(path, validators)

##### Validators
The validators mimic the structure of the response you're validating. For example, if your API returns the following json on a get call with Alex specified in the URL:

```ruby
{
  "name": "Alex",
  "address": {
    "street": "Area 51",
    "city": "Roswell",
    "state": "NM",
    "coordinates": {
      "latitude": 33.3872,
      "longitude": 104.5281 } },
  "phones": [
    { "type": "cell",
      "number": "123-456-7890"},
    { "type": "home",
      "number": "987-654-3210"} ]
}
```

some possible validations are:

```ruby
expect_json(name: 'Alex') # exact match because you asked for Alex
expect_json_types(name: :string, address: {street: :string, city: :string, state: :string,
  coordinates: {latitude: :float, longitude: :float}},
  phones: :array_of_objects) # all the types and structure (cannot go into arrays this way)
expect_json('address', state: /^[A-Z]{2}$/) # ensures address/state has 2 capital letters
expect_json_types('phones.*', type: :string, number: :string) # looks at all elements in array
expect_json_types('phones.1', type: :string, number: :string) # looks at second element in array
expect_json_keys('address', [:street, :city, :state, :coordinates]) # ensure specified keys present
expect_json_sizes(phones: 2) # expect the phones array size to be 2
```

Additionally, if an entire object could be null, but you'd still want to test the types if it does exist, you can wrap the expectations in a call to `optional`:

```ruby
it 'should allow optional nested hash' do
  get '/simple_path_get' #may or may not return coordinates
  expect_json_types('address.coordinates', optional(latitude: :float, longitude: :float))
end
```

Additionally, when calling `expect_json`, you can provide a regex pattern in a call to `regex`:

```ruby
describe 'sample spec' do
  it 'should validate types' do
    get 'http://example.com/api/v1/simple_get' #json api that returns { "name" : "John Doe" }
    expect_json(name: regex("^John"))
  end
end
```

When calling `expect_json` or `expect_json_types`, you can optionally provide a block and run your own `rspec` expectations:

```ruby
describe 'sample spec' do
  it 'should validate types' do
    get 'http://example.com/api/v1/simple_get' #json api that returns { "name" : "John Doe" }
    expect_json(name: -> (name){ expect(name.length).to eq(8) })
  end
end
```

When calling `expect_*_types`, these are the valid types that can be tested against:

* `:int` or `:integer`
* `:float`
* `:bool` or `:boolean`
* `:string`
* `:date`
* `:object`
* `:null`
* `:array`
* `:array_of_integers` or `:array_of_ints`
* `:array_of_floats`
* `:array_of_strings`
* `:array_of_booleans` or `:array_of_bools`
* `:array_of_objects`
* `:array_of_arrays`

If the properties are optional and may not appear in the response, you can append `_or_null` to the types above.

Validation for headers follows the same pattern as above, although nesting of multiple levels isn't going to be needed.
	
## Extensions to Airborne

1. Uses curlyrest to allow extension of rest-client with curl requests
2. Uses wrap_request to bundle groups of expectations so that if any fail, the failure will contain the last request and response, rather than just seeing the expectation that failed
3. json_body is only parsed once after a request rather than on each expect call (spaceborne resets the json_body on a new http request).
4. Expectations for headers use the same form as the expectations for json bodies.
  * `expect_header same arguments/handling as expect_json`
  * `expect_header_types same arguments/handling as expect_json_types`
5. It is possible to use non-json data in a request
6. Expectations on a response with an array of hashes with keys that are unknown, but that have a defined structure are supported (using the '*' in a path)
7. Responses that have header with Content-Encoding of gzip are gunzip'd in json_body
8. For type checks specified in a path containing array(s), you can make the path optional, so that if the data is present it is type checked, but an empty array or element without the array is fine

The following example shows how extensions # 6 & 8 work

```ruby
{ "array_of_hashes": [
    { "husband": {"first": "fred", "last": "flinstone"}},
    { "buddy": {"first": "barney", "last": "rubble"}},
    { "wife": {"first": "wilma", "last": "flinstone"}}
  ],
  "hash_of_hashes": 
  { "husband": {"first": "fred", "last": "flinstone"},
    "buddy": {"first": "barney", "last": "rubble"},
    "wife": {"first": "wilma", "last": "flinstone"}
  },
  "lowest_array": [{ "array": [{ "present": "name" }]},
		   { "array": null },
		   { "array": [] },
		   { "foo": "bar" }],
  "highest_array": [ null,
		     { "array": [{ "present": "name" }]}],
  "not_an_array":  null
}
```
You can now validate the fact that each element in the collection has a key which is variant, but a value that has a defined format (the first and last field values are strings).

    expect_json_types('array_of_hashes.*.*', first: :string, last: :string)
    expect_json_types('hash_of_hashes.*', first: :string, last: :string)
    expect_json_types(optional('lowest_array.*.array.*'), present: :string)
    expect_json_types(optional('highest_array.*.array.*'), present: :string)
